### Introduction

In today's globalized society, the ability to communicate across language barriers is essential for fostering understanding and collaboration. Voice translation systems, particularly those that convert spoken language into text and subsequently translate that text into another language, are crucial for enhancing communication in various domains, such as tourism, international business, and diplomatic relations.

### Problem

The problem weâ€™re aiming to improve is the need for more accurate and efficient voice translations for individuals traveling or engaging in communication with people who speak different languages. 

### Motivation

When tourists, business professionals, or international students visit countries where German is spoken, they often encounter challenges in understanding written materials, menus, signs, or conducting simple conversations. Existing translation systems frequently produce translations that are grammatically incorrect, contextually inaccurate, or fail to capture cultural nuances. This leads to miscommunication, frustration, and inefficiency during travel, business, and everyday interactions.
